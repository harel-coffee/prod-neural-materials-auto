# Analysis Folder

These are scripts and snippet libraries we found useful for our analysis. We redundancied a couple of our analyses in both Python and R, in which case we have included both.

Note that they are provided without any guarantees for correctness, and several of them have been written for other data sources or for the data before we sanitized it or changed its schema, so would need to be adapted. 

Maybe they will still be a useful starting point.

For some light documentation, see [cookbook.md](cookbook.md) and [metric_selection.md](metric_selection.md).
